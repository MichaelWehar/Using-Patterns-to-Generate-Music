# What is it?
A simple experiment to test and see how pattern frequency can be applied to generate music.

# How does it work?
Given a sequence of digits, it builds up a frequency table.  This table represents how often certain patterns appear.

Then, based on the fequencies, it guesses which digits would come next.  Finally, it plays the string of digits as if each digit is a different note or audio file.

# Audio
The audio can be found in the samples folder.  The audio comes from: http://www.freesound.org/
